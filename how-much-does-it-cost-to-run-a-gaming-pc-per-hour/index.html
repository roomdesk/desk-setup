<p>So, how much does it cost to let a gaming pc run the entire day? This means that if a pc is on for eight hours a day, it will cost 10p a day to run the laptop (based on an average energy unit cost of 12.5 p/kwh). In reality i use my computer about 5 hours a day, with about half games (200 watts) and half just surfing, etc (120 watts) so say average 160 watts x 8 hours x $.13 x 30 days = $5. Draws around 300 watts with everything running.</p>
